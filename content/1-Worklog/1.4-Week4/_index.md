# Week 4 - Containerization and CI Quality Gates

## Objectives

Week 4 focused on making the project repeatable: Dockerfiles, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions quality gates, local validation scripts, smoke tests, and security checks.

## Tasks Completed

| Status | Task | Evidence basis |
|---|---|---|
| Completed | Standardized Docker build paths for backend, chat, frontend, and AI service. | `backend/Dockerfile`, `chat-service/Dockerfile`, `frontend/Dockerfile`, and `Dockerfile.ai-service`. |
| Completed | Kept local Compose as the parity environment for dependencies and smoke tests. | `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.ai-service.yml`, and `scripts/ci/smoke-test.sh`. |
| Completed | Consolidated GitHub Actions into the main CI/CD workflow. | `.github/workflows/cicd.yml` and commit `e09e84e`. |
| Completed | Added required quality/security gates. | `scripts/ci/repository_quality.py`, `scripts/ci/infrastructure.py`, `scripts/ci/security_scan.py`, `.gitleaks.toml`, and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. |
| Completed | Fixed ShellCheck SC2155 in the smoke test script. | Commit `98f3420`. |
| Partially completed | Attached GitHub Actions screenshots and full before/after logs where available. | Evidence pending: I did not have the full CI screenshot/log artifact set in the local evidence archive. |

## Technical Implementation

The final CI workflow defines validation jobs for backend, chat service, frontend, Docker images, infrastructure, smoke checks, and security scanning. The workflow uses Python 3.12, Node.js 22, shell validation, Docker image builds, Trivy/Gitleaks images, and actionlint/kubeconform support through the infrastructure script.

Relevant workflow checks include:

```bash
python -m ruff format --check .
python -m ruff check .
python -m mypy app tests
python -m pytest -m "not postgres"
npm run check --prefix chat-service
npm run lint --prefix chat-service
npm run format:check --prefix chat-service
npm run test:ci --prefix chat-service
npm run test --prefix frontend
npm run build --prefix frontend
docker build -t internship-backend:ci ./backend
docker build -t internship-chat:ci ./chat-service
docker build -f Dockerfile.ai-service -t internship-ai:ci .
```

## Problems and Solutions

| Problem | Root cause | Resolution | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Multiple workflows made the deployment path harder to control. | Separate CI/deploy workflows split validation and deployment behavior. | Consolidated workflows into `.github/workflows/cicd.yml`. | Completed |
| ShellCheck flagged SC2155 in the smoke test script. | Assignment and command substitution were combined in a way ShellCheck warns about. | Commit `98f3420` split the logic to satisfy ShellCheck. | Completed |
| `.env` files can contain UTF-8 BOM and break shell parsing. | Windows editors may add BOM at the beginning of files. | `scripts/ci/smoke-test.sh` strips the BOM when preparing smoke-test env input. | Completed |
| Docker-based infra validation may hang or fail when Docker is unavailable. | Local Windows/Docker setups vary by machine. | Infrastructure scripts support local CLI binaries and bounded Docker fallback behavior. | Completed |
| Full CI result screenshots are missing from the Hugo report. | GitHub Actions artifacts were not attached locally. | I kept CI log screenshots pending. | Blocked |

## Testing, Build and Deployment Results

| Area | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Backend CI commands | Implemented | Commands are defined in `.github/workflows/cicd.yml`. Current-run output is pending. |
| Chat CI commands | Implemented | Commands are defined in `.github/workflows/cicd.yml` and `scripts/chat-service.sh`. Current-run output is pending. |
| Frontend CI commands | Implemented | Commands are defined in `.github/workflows/cicd.yml` and `scripts/frontend.sh`. Current-run output is pending. |
| Infrastructure/security checks | Implemented | `scripts/ci/infrastructure.py`, `scripts/check-infra.ps1`, `scripts/check-infra.sh`, and `scripts/ci/security_scan.py` exist. |
| Compose smoke test | Implemented | `scripts/ci/smoke-test.sh` exists and ends with `Compose smoke test passed` on success. Current-run output is pending. |

### Test Logs

Evidence pending: attach CI or local output for backend, chat, frontend, and smoke-test jobs.

### Build Logs

Evidence pending: attach Docker build and Vite build output from GitHub Actions or a local run.

### Deployment Logs

Not applicable for Week 4. This phase prepared deployable artifacts and gates, while AWS/EKS deployment continued in later weeks.

## Weekly Results

The project gained a single CI/CD backbone, repeatable quality gates, Docker build paths, smoke-test handling, and security/infrastructure validation scripts.

## Lessons Learned

CI should fail early on repeatable checks: formatting, typing, tests, build, security, shell syntax, Dockerfile quality, and infrastructure manifest validation. Making these checks explicit reduced the amount of manual inspection needed before deployment.

## Next Week Plan

Move from Docker Compose to local Kubernetes with kind, Kubernetes manifests, migration/init jobs, probes, HPA/PDB configuration, and observability resources.
