## Objectives

Week 5 focused on running the application in local Kubernetes using kind. The goal was to move from Compose-only development to Kubernetes Deployments, Services, Jobs, ConfigMaps, Secrets, ingress, autoscaling, and observability resources.

## Tasks Completed

| Status | Task | Evidence basis |
|---|---|---|
| Completed | Added kind cluster configuration. | `k8s/cluster/kind-config.yaml` and commit `8dae02c`. |
| Completed | Added Kubernetes resources for backend, chat, PostgreSQL, Redis, DynamoDB Local, migration job, and chat initialization job. | `k8s/app/*.yaml`. |
| Completed | Added local deployment automation for PowerShell and shell users. | `scripts/k8s/deploy-local.ps1` and `scripts/k8s/deploy-local.sh`. |
| Completed | Added HPA and PDB definitions for app services. | `k8s/app/autoscaling.yaml`. |
| Completed | Added observability resources for Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Alloy, OTel collector, ServiceMonitors, and PrometheusRules. | `k8s/observability/*` and `observability/grafana/*`. |
| Partially completed | Captured live `kubectl` screenshots and command logs where available. | Evidence pending: I did not have the full screenshot/log artifact set in the local evidence archive. |

## Technical Implementation

The local Kubernetes path uses kind for the cluster, in-cluster PostgreSQL/Redis/DynamoDB Local for dependencies, and Kubernetes manifests under `k8s/app` for the workload layer.

The deployment scripts build local images, load them into kind, apply app manifests, run migration/init jobs, wait for rollouts, and print port-forward commands for backend, chat, and optional AI service checks.

## Problems and Solutions

| Problem | Root cause | Resolution | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compose did not prove Kubernetes readiness. | Services could work locally while still missing probes, Services, Jobs, or ConfigMaps. | Added Kubernetes manifests and local deployment scripts. | Completed |
| Fresh local images might not be used by kind. | Building an image is not enough; kind nodes need the image loaded. | Scripts run `kind load docker-image` and restart deployments. | Completed |
| Migrations and chat table creation need ordered startup. | API/chat pods should not assume databases are initialized. | Added `backend-migrate` and `chat-init` Jobs. | Completed |
| Local observability required multiple supporting components. | Metrics, logs, and traces need separate platform services. | Added Helm-backed Prometheus/Grafana/Loki/Tempo/Alloy resources and local runbook guidance. | Completed |
| Live cluster screenshots are missing. | Runtime screenshots were not attached to the local evidence archive. | I kept Kubernetes evidence pending. | Blocked |

## Testing, Build and Deployment Results

| Area | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes manifests | Implemented | `k8s/app` includes Deployments, Services, Jobs, ConfigMaps, Secret examples, ingress, HPA, and PDB. |
| Local deployment scripts | Implemented | `scripts/k8s/deploy-local.ps1` and `.sh` automate cluster setup, image load, jobs, rollouts, and resource display. |
| Observability resources | Implemented | `k8s/observability` and `observability/grafana` include dashboards, datasources, rules, and collectors. |
| Runtime validation logs | Partially completed | Commands are scripted, but current report does not include saved `kubectl` output. |

## Evidence

### Screenshots

### Test Logs

Evidence pending: attach actual local Kubernetes output from commands such as:

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -n internship
kubectl get services -n internship
kubectl rollout status deployment/backend -n internship
kubectl rollout status deployment/chat-service -n internship
```

### Build Logs

Evidence pending: attach output from local image builds and `kind load docker-image` commands.

### Deployment Logs

Evidence pending: attach output from `scripts/k8s/deploy-local.ps1` or `scripts/k8s/deploy-local.sh`.

## Weekly Results

The project moved from local Compose toward a Kubernetes-shaped runtime. Backend, chat, dependencies, jobs, workers, ingress, autoscaling, and observability resources were represented in manifests and deployment scripts.

## Lessons Learned

Local Kubernetes validation is more than checking that pods start. Jobs, readiness probes, image freshness, DNS, service ports, ingress, HPA metrics, and observability scraping all need explicit checks.

## Next Week Plan

Prepare the AWS foundation: AWS CLI validation, region selection, GitHub OIDC, IAM deployment role, ECR repositories, and image build/push workflow.
