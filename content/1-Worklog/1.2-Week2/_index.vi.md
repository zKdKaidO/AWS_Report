# Week 2 - Concurrency Control and Data Integrity

## Objectives

Week 2 focused on making write operations safe when several backend or chat pods handle requests at the same time. The target was to prevent duplicate registrations, duplicate applications, stale workflow updates, and duplicate chat messages without using global application-level locks.

## Tasks Completed

| Status | Task | Evidence basis |
|---|---|---|
| Completed | Analyzed concurrent writes across multiple backend pods. | `docs/architecture/concurrency-policy.md`. |
| Completed | Documented optimistic and pessimistic UI policies. | `docs/architecture/concurrency-policy.md` and `docs/frontend/COMMAND_MUTATION_POLICY.md`. |
| Completed | Added database-backed idempotency for candidate apply requests. | `backend/app/services/idempotency_service.py`, `backend/app/routers/jobs.py`, and migration `0004_idempotency_records.py`. |
| Completed | Added version-gated workflow commands using `expectedVersion`. | `backend/app/services/optimistic_concurrency.py`, `backend/app/services/workflow_commands.py`, and HR/Candidate routers. |
| Completed | Hardened chat writes against duplicate retry behavior. | `chat-service/repositories/chatRepository.js` and `chat-service/tests/chatRepository.concurrency.test.js`. |
| Partially completed | Attached visible API screenshots and CI logs where available. | Evidence pending: I did not have a screenshot or GitHub Actions log artifact in the local evidence archive. |

## Technical Implementation

Concurrency control was implemented at the database and API-contract level:

- PostgreSQL unique constraints protect duplicate user, company, application, and idempotency records.
- `Idempotency-Key` is accepted for candidate application submission and selected workflow commands.
- Reusing the same idempotency key with the same payload replays the stored response.
- Reusing the same idempotency key with a different payload returns `409` with `idempotency_key_reused`.
- Mutable HR job and application commands require `expectedVersion`.
- Stale version updates return controlled `409 Conflict` responses.
- Chat retries use deterministic client message IDs and DynamoDB conditional write behavior to avoid duplicate logical messages.

## Problems and Solutions

| Problem | Root cause | Resolution | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Duplicate registration or company creation could surface as uncontrolled database errors. | Unique constraints existed or were needed, but error translation had to be explicit. | Integrity errors are rolled back and translated into `409 Conflict`. | Completed |
| Candidate apply can be retried by browser/network clients. | A second request may reach another backend pod before the first response is received. | Scoped idempotency records persist request hash and response data. | Completed |
| HR workflow updates can become stale when two users act on the same job/application. | Plain updates do not know whether the client saw the latest row version. | Commands require `expectedVersion` and use conditional updates. | Completed |
| Chat retries can duplicate realtime messages. | Socket retries and REST retries can re-send the same logical message. | Chat repository uses deterministic message identity and skips duplicate broadcast on replay. | Completed |
| Public evidence for a `409` screenshot is missing. | The source repo contains tests and docs, but no screenshot artifact. | I kept screenshot evidence pending. | Blocked |

## Testing, Build and Deployment Results

| Area | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Backend concurrency tests | Partially completed | Test sources exist: `backend/tests/test_apply_idempotency.py`, `backend/tests/test_apply_idempotency_postgres.py`, `backend/tests/test_optimistic_concurrency.py`, and `backend/tests/test_optimistic_concurrency_postgres.py`. Current-run output is pending. |
| Chat concurrency tests | Partially completed | Test source exists: `chat-service/tests/chatRepository.concurrency.test.js`. Current-run output is pending. |
| API conflict behavior | Implemented | Source contains explicit `409` handling for stale versions, duplicate apply, and idempotency-key reuse. |
| Deployment | Planned | This week focused on correctness before deployment. |

### Test Logs

Evidence pending: attach actual output from commands such as:

```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/test_apply_idempotency.py tests/test_optimistic_concurrency.py
python -m pytest -m postgres tests/test_apply_idempotency_postgres.py tests/test_optimistic_concurrency_postgres.py
```

### Build Logs

Not applicable for the core Week 2 task. No dedicated build artifact was found for this phase.

### Deployment Logs

Not applicable for Week 2. The feature was designed to be safe before scaling the backend in Kubernetes.

## Weekly Results

The application gained stronger data-integrity guarantees: duplicate writes are constrained by PostgreSQL or DynamoDB, client retries are handled through idempotency records, stale updates produce `409 Conflict`, and chat replay behavior avoids duplicate broadcasts.

## Lessons Learned

Service load balancing does not serialize writes. Correctness must be enforced at the storage and transaction boundary, then reflected clearly through API response codes and UI behavior.

## Next Week Plan

Build the transactional outbox and asynchronous processing layers so committed domain changes can trigger reliable downstream work without keeping the main API request open.
