# Monitoring and Logging

## Objective

Monitor application health, deployment state, logs, metrics, queues, Lambda processing, and AWS managed services.

## Architecture context

The repository contains Kubernetes ServiceMonitor and PrometheusRule manifests for application metrics. AWS-side CloudWatch metrics and alarms must be verified from the target account before being marked as deployed.

## Kubernetes resource inspection

Use `kubectl get` for fast status checks:

```bash
kubectl get deployments,pods,svc,endpoints,hpa,pdb,jobs -n internship -o wide
kubectl get ingress internship-public -n internship
kubectl get events -n internship --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
```

Expected result:

- `backend` and `chat-service` have Ready replicas.
- `backend-outbox-dispatcher` is Ready.
- `backend-processing-worker` is either Ready or intentionally scaled to zero.
- `ai-service` is Ready when AI deployment is enabled.
- `backend-migrate` and `chat-init` have completed.

## Rollout status

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/backend -n internship --timeout=300s
kubectl rollout status deployment/chat-service -n internship --timeout=300s
kubectl rollout status deployment/backend-outbox-dispatcher -n internship --timeout=300s
kubectl rollout status deployment/backend-processing-worker -n internship --timeout=300s
kubectl rollout status deployment/ai-service -n internship --timeout=900s
```

Only check `ai-service` when AI deployment is enabled.

## Application logs

```bash
kubectl logs deployment/backend -n internship --tail=200
kubectl logs deployment/chat-service -n internship --tail=200
kubectl logs deployment/backend-outbox-dispatcher -n internship --tail=200
kubectl logs deployment/backend-processing-worker -n internship --tail=200
kubectl logs deployment/ai-service -n internship --tail=200
```

Use `--previous` when a container has restarted:

```bash
kubectl logs deployment/backend -n internship --previous --tail=200
```

## Describe commands

Use `kubectl describe` when readiness, scheduling, probes, or Ingress reconciliation fail:

```bash
kubectl describe pod -n internship -l app=backend
kubectl describe pod -n internship -l app=chat-service
kubectl describe hpa backend -n internship
kubectl describe ingress internship-public -n internship
```

## Health endpoints

Backend readiness checks PostgreSQL:

```bash
curl -fsS https://dhm2rz5nmsibj.cloudfront.net/api/health/ready
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status":"ready","service":"internship-api","dependencies":{"postgres":true}}
```

Chat readiness checks Redis and DynamoDB:

```bash
curl -fsS https://dhm2rz5nmsibj.cloudfront.net/chat/health/ready
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status":"ready","dependencies":{"redis":true,"dynamodb":true}}
```

AI readiness checks that `SAGEMAKER_ENDPOINT_NAME` is configured:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/ai-service 18082:8010 -n internship
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:18082/health/ready
```

## Prometheus and Grafana

The repository defines ServiceMonitor resources for:

- `backend`
- `chat-service`
- `backend-outbox-dispatcher`
- `backend-processing-worker`

Apply when the Prometheus Operator CRDs are installed:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/observability/service-monitors.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/observability/prometheus-rules.yaml
```

Verify:

```bash
kubectl get servicemonitor,prometheusrule -n monitoring
kubectl port-forward service/kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus 9092:9090 -n monitoring
curl -fsS "http://127.0.0.1:9092/api/v1/targets?state=active"
```

Expected application targets:

- `backend`
- `chat-service`
- `backend-outbox-dispatcher`
- `backend-processing-worker`

## Repository-defined alerts

The repository includes Prometheus alerts for:

| Alert | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `InternshipBackendDown` | Backend metrics target unavailable |
| `InternshipChatDown` | Chat metrics target unavailable |
| `InternshipChatDependencyDown` | Chat Redis or DynamoDB dependency unavailable |
| `InternshipOutboxDispatcherDown` | Dispatcher metrics target unavailable |
| `InternshipProcessingWorkerDown` | Processing worker metrics target unavailable |
| `InternshipBackend5xxHigh` | Elevated backend 5xx rate |
| `InternshipBackendP95LatencyHigh` | High backend p95 latency |
| `InternshipChatMessageFailureRatioHigh` | High chat message failure rate |
| `InternshipPodCrashLooping` | Pod CrashLoopBackOff |
| `InternshipOutboxDeadEventsPresent` | Dead outbox events need operator action |
| `InternshipOutboxPendingTooOld` | Pending outbox event age too high |
| `InternshipOutboxTransportErrors` | SQS transport errors |
| `InternshipProcessingQueueOld` | Processing queue age too high |
| `InternshipProcessingJobsFailing` | Processing jobs failing |
| `InternshipAIProviderFailures` | AI provider failures |

Status: implemented in repository manifests. Evidence required to prove these were applied in production.

## CloudWatch Logs

Check Lambda logs:

```bash
aws logs describe-log-groups \
  --log-group-name-prefix /aws/lambda/internship-outbox-handler \
  --region ap-southeast-1

aws logs tail /aws/lambda/internship-outbox-handler \
  --since 1h \
  --region ap-southeast-1
```

Check EKS-related logs only if container log shipping is configured. Evidence required: CloudWatch log group names for backend, chat, worker, dispatcher, and AI service.

## AWS managed-service metrics

| Service | Useful metrics |
|---|---|
| ALB | `HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count`, `TargetResponseTime`, healthy hosts, LCUs |
| CloudFront | requests, 4xx/5xx rate, origin latency, bytes downloaded |
| RDS | CPU, free storage, connections, read/write IOPS, replica lag if any |
| ElastiCache Redis | CPU, memory, evictions, current connections |
| DynamoDB | throttled requests, consumed read/write capacity, system errors |
| SQS | approximate visible messages, age of oldest message, DLQ visible messages |
| Lambda | errors, duration, throttles, iterator age, concurrent executions |
| SageMaker | endpoint invocation errors, model latency, overhead latency, instance utilization |

## Proposed CloudWatch alarms

These alarms are recommended. Evidence required before marking them deployed:

| Alarm | Recommended condition |
|---|---|
| DLQ messages visible | `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible > 0` on `internship-prod-outbox-dlq` |
| Main queue age high | Oldest SQS message age exceeds operational threshold |
| Lambda errors | `Errors > 0` for `internship-outbox-handler` |
| Lambda throttles | `Throttles > 0` |
| ALB target 5xx high | Target 5xx count/rate above threshold |
| RDS CPU high | CPU above sustained threshold |
| RDS free storage low | Free storage below threshold |
| Redis memory high | Memory or evictions above threshold |
| SageMaker errors | Invocation/model errors above threshold |
| CloudFront 5xx high | 5xx error rate above threshold |

## Expected result

- Kubernetes deployments are Ready.
- Health endpoints pass through CloudFront.
- Logs are available for each EKS workload and Lambda.
- Prometheus can scrape application metrics when observability is installed.
- SQS, Lambda, RDS, Redis, DynamoDB, ALB, CloudFront, and SageMaker metrics are visible in CloudWatch.
- Proposed alarms are either deployed and evidenced or clearly listed as proposed.

## Common errors

| Symptom | Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `kubectl top` has no data | Metrics server unavailable or not scraped yet | Check metrics-server rollout |
| Prometheus target down | ServiceMonitor selector or namespace mismatch | Inspect Service labels and ServiceMonitor selectors |
| Chat health not ready | Redis or DynamoDB dependency down | Check chat logs and AWS service status |
| Lambda logs absent | Function not invoked or wrong region | Confirm event-source mapping and region |
| DLQ growing | Lambda or downstream processing failure | Inspect DLQ messages and Lambda logs |

## Outcome

Monitoring is complete when operational staff can inspect Kubernetes state, logs, health endpoints, Prometheus metrics, CloudWatch metrics, Lambda logs, SQS/DLQ state, and alarms without exposing secrets.
